# Deterministic Analysis and Stochastic Simulation of SIS and SIR Models

This repository accompanies the project "Deterministic Analysis And Stochastic Simulation Of SIS And SIR Models", by Giancarlo Antonucci, submitted as part of the BEng in Physical Engineering at Politecnico di Torino.

This project was completed under the supervision of Dr Igor Stievano. Both SIS and SIR models were discussed and approached so as to find special patterns. The results and the DTMC simulation obtained with a Matlab code were then
compared.

sis.m and sir.m contain the relevant deterministic and stochastic analyses.
